# FindingShipTrafficByUsingPhysicsFormulas
This is my second year first semester project<br>
Here Program takes each ship object information like starting time,x - coordinate,angle  from file.<br>
From these it calculates whether these two ships will meet at same point or not by using the physics formula that I derived
